<p>The Headless Horseman from The Legend of Sleepy Hollow by Washington Irving. All right, so this isn't truly a ghost (or is it?), but it's perfect for Halloween. New schoolmaster Ichabod Crane falls for an heiress, Katrina, and (SPOILER) after a night of hearing ghost stories and getting rejected by Katrina, Ichabod is chased out of town by a headless horseman who throws a pumpkin at him. That's mostly the story. </p>

<p>The ghosts from A Christmas Carol by Charles Dickens: The Ghost of Christmas Past, The Ghost of Christmas Present and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, and Jacob Marley. A miserly old man (SPOILER: he's called Scrooge) is visited by the ghost of his former business partner and three spirits during Christmas to show him the error of his ways and help him not be such a jerk-o-lantern. (Too much to include a Halloween pun for a book set during Christmas? I think not.)</p>

<p>The hotel ghosts from The Shining by Stephen King. There are quite a few ghosts, supernatural forces and an alcoholic father all stuck together in the isolated Overlook Hotel, and it's the hotel that desires to possess Danny, a young boy, with the gift of the "shining." </p>
